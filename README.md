## Python formatter

We use `autopep8` to format our code. Properly set your IDE to automatically 
format the python file before saving.

## Commit message convention

The commit message should be structured as follows, quoted from [here](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/):

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

The types are specified as followed:
- **fix**: patches a bug in the codebase.
- **feat**: introduces a new feature to the codebase.
- **style**: codebase changes related to code format problems
- **doc**
- **chore**
- **refactor**
- ......

## Commit as often as possible

Break down the code you implemented into small parts and commit as soon as you
finish a small part.

**DO NOT** squash all the work into one commit!

## Multiple authors for a commit

If there are multiple authors for a commit (for example, pair-programming), follow the instructions from this
[link](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/creating-a-commit-with-multiple-authors#creating-co-authored-commits-on-the-command-line)
here to add co-authors.
